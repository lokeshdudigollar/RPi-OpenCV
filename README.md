# RPi-OpenCV

To create a complete project on Face Recognition, we must work on 3 very distinct phases:

Face Detection and Data Gathering
Train the Recognizer
Face Recognition

Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images
